60% more torque at 2/3 the efficiency!

This is my 70:1 split ring planetary gearbox for the PolyFormer. It uses the existing gearbox as a base and should be a drop-in replacement. This reuses the original gearbox fan and cap, make sure to print those as well. Print two of each of the planet gears. When assembling, the planet gears should be evenly spaced around the ring gear (ie 90 degrees apart) and matching planets should be opposite each other.

Print in PLA/PLA+ using the recommended PF print settings. I haven't tested this design with other materials but I'd avoid PETG as it flexes too much and will likely cause binding. If you print it out of something other than PLA/PLA+ I'd be interested to know how you go!

Tolerances are mostly baked into the design. I printed everything with Vertical Hole shrinking compensation set to 0.2mm in SuperSlicer, you might want to do the same. If the shaft bore for the stepper motor is too tight, try bumping that up to 0.25 or 0.3. 

Heat set inserts go into the 4 holes in the output gear and these line up with the holes in the spool holder. These are the same M3 x 5 x 4 heat set inserts as used in the PF BOM.
