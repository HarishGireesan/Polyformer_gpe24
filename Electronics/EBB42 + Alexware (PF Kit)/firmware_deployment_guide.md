# EBB42: Firmware Deployment Guide
---

The EBB42 has no firmware installed by default when shipped out. You can manage the firmware using dfu-util, Arduino IDE and STM32CubeProgrammer.<!-- , Particle CLI, Particle Cloud, Ymodem and OpenOCD. -->


* [Using STM32Programmer](https://youtu.be/_FELCN8CbWA?t=385): STM32Programmer may be easier if you prefer a graphical interface. This video by Eddie shows you how to install any firmware on EBB42, you just need to load the PolyFormerFW_Vx.x.bin file instead.

* [Using dfu-util](#using-dfu-util): You can update all of the internal flash memory, system firmware and any other bianry files if you need, except the bootloader itself.

* [Using Arduino IDE](#using-arduino-ide): You can update system firmware and  user application. If you have a ST-LINK in hand, you can even update the bootloader.


## <span id="using-dfu-util">Using dfu-util</span>

Before using the dfu-util, you have to install it first. Please follow the [dfu-util Installation Guide](dfu-util_installation_guide.md) to install it on your computer.

For Windows users, if you havn't installed the DFU USB driver for EBB42, please follow the [Windows Driver Installation Guide](windows_driver_installation_guide.md) to install the driver first.

**All of the firmware images are available on this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Reiten966/Polyformer/tree/main/Electronics/EBB42%20%2B%20Alexware).** Just download what you need.

dfu-util command line options:

* `-d` : specify the DFU device's USB ID. For EBB42 it is "df11:0483"
* `-a` : specify the interface of the memory. For EBB42 it has three interfaces.
    - `0` : access the internal memory space, except the bootloader memory space
    - `1` : access the application DCT (not the entire DCT) memory space
    - `2` : access the external SPI flash memory space
* `-s` : specify the offset address of the memory space to store the binary file from
* `-D` : the binary (.bin) file specified is going to be downloaded to the DFU device
* `-U` : the binary (.bin) file specified is going to store the raw data that is dunmped from DFU device
* `:leave` : append this option to the offset address will make device exit DFU Mode, e.g. `-s 0x80C0000:leave`.

Now make your EBB42 enter DFU Mode:

1. Hold down BOTH buttons
2. Release only the RST button, while holding down the BOOT button.
3. Wait for 1 second
4. Release the BOOT button

#### Update System Firmware

* Update system:    
`dfu-util -d df11:0483 -a 0 -s 0x8000000 -D 
PolyFormerFW_Vx.x.bin`

#### Sample Output
    dfu-util 0.11

<!-- ## <span id="using-arduino-ide">Using Arduino IDE</span>

If this is your first time playing with the EBB42 using Arduino IDE, you are recommended to follow the [Getting Started with Arduino IDE](getting_started_with_arduino_ide.md) to set up the Arduino environment first. -->

<!-- #### Update User Application (aka. Arduino sketch)

To upload your sketch, simply click on the ![image](images/Upload_icon.png) icon.

#### Update System Firmware
##### 1. via Native USB Port

If you connect your EBB42 directly to the computer, you can update the EBB42's system firmware, by using the "**EBB42 FW Uploader**" programmer.  The factory reset application will also be updated.

- Connect your EBB42 to computer and put it in DFU mode:

    - Hold down BOTH buttons
    - Release only the RST button, while holding down the BOOT button.
    - Wait for 1 second
    - Release the SETUP button

- Select the board: "Tools > Board: EBB42 (Native USB Port)"

- Select the programmer:  "Tools > Programmer: EBB42 FW Uploader"

- Click on "Tools > Burn Bootloader" to update the system firmware.

- After the burn bootloader operation completed, the on-board blue LED start blinking rapidly, since it has also downloaded a blink application, in case that your old application is not compatible with the updated system firmware.

##### 2. via ST-LINK USB Port

If you mount your EBB42 onto ST-LINK and connect the ST-LINK to your computer, you can update the EBB42's bootloader and its system firmware by using the "**ST-LINK**" programmer.

- Mount your EBB42 (be aware of the orientation) onto ST-LINK and connect the ST-LINK to your computer

- Select the board: "Tools > Board: RedBear EBB42 (ST-LINK USB Port)"

- Select the programmer:  "Tools > Programmer: ST-LINK"

- Click on "Tools > Burn Bootloader" to update the bootloader and system firmware.

- After the burn bootloader operation completed, the on-board blue LED start blinking rapidly, since it has also downloaded a blink application, in case that your old application is not compatible with the updated system firmware. -->
