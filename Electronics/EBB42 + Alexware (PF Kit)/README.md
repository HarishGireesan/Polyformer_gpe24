Firmware for the PolyFormer stand alone pulling system

Compilation instructions

1.  Install Arduino IDE
    You get the latest Arduino IDE here:
    http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

3.  Install STM32CubeIDE
	Download and install STM32CubeProgrammer from the 'STM32CubePrg' folder here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L-q9MlswSXPIMe1Jg1lsA1I1AFvQ9x0S?usp=sharing.

	(Alternatively you can download by following URL: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html
	Warning: it is necessary to create a my.st.com account, if using this link.)

2.  Install STM32Duino
	Once Arduino IDE is installed, launch Arduino IDE then go to File > Preferences
	In “Additional Boards Manager URLs”, enter the following URL : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/master/STM32/package_stm_index.json
	Enter “OK”
	Then : Tools > Board : ___ > Boards Manager...
	Enter in the search bar “STM32” or “stm” and download the package by clicking on install.

4.  Install the required libraries
	Go to Sketch > Library and choose "Manage Libraries..."
	Search for, and install the following (and any dependancies if prompted):
	"NTC_Thermistor"
	"PID"
	"Bounce2"
	"U8g2"
	"TCMenu"
	"GyverNTC"
	"TMCStepper"

5.  Start Arduino IDE and open the file "PolyFormerFW.ino"

5.  Select the board and port to upload via in the arduino ide.
	Launch Arduino IDE with a STM32 plugged in USB on the computer.
	Go to Tools > Board: ___ > STM32 boards groups... > and choose "Generic STM32G0 series"
	Then go to Tools > Board part number: ___ and choose "Generic G0B1RBTx"
	Go to Tools > USB support:___ and choose "CDC (generic 'Serial' supersede U(S)ART)"
	In Tools > Upload method: ___ choose STM32CubeProgrammer (DFU)
	Then : Tools > Port: ___ and choose the corresponding port to your STM32 board.

6.  Check PolyFormerFW.ino for hints, if something needs to be checked or modified.

7.  Upload the firmware with the upload button (right arrow in toolbar). -->
